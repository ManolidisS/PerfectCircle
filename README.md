# PerfectCircle
A program designed to get good scores on https://neal.fun/perfect-circle/

# Notes
- The circle is centred approximately at the centre of your primary display.
- The program only works for windows.

If you don't have the `mouse` and `keyboard` packges installed, they can be installed with the command `pip install mouse keyboard`. Other packages used should come pre-installed with python.

# Credits
Thanks to Stevoisiak & jcao219 on Stackoverflow, I used their code to find the resolution of the primary display (https://stackoverflow.com/a/3129524/19802075)
